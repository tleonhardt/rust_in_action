# rust_in_action

This is my repo to follow along with the book [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) by Tim McNamara.

The official source code repository for the book can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rust-in-action/code).

You should install Rust using the official [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) installer.
